Installation should be as simple as doing a ./configure;make install

Use ./configure --prefix=/path/to/install to change the default install
location of /usr/local. I install alsaplayer in my /opt tree so I configure it
as follows:

./configure --prefix=/opt

The alsaplayer binary will then be placed in /opt/bin after the make install.
(it is in /usr/local/bin by default). For a complete list of configure options
run the configure script with --help

Installing from CVS (broken for now)
====================================

If you have a copy of alsaplayer checked out from the CVS, you should run
the autogen.sh script to create the makefiles and configure the package,
and then run make to compile it.

Run

  ./autogen.sh

with the same arguments you would use for ./configure, e.g.

  ./autogen.sh --enable-debug --disable-nls

Note: if you require a remotely stable release, do not use the CVS version.
Get the latest release from http://www.alsa-project.org/~andy/, or a packaged
and built release from one of the sites listed on that page.
