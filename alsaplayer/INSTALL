Installation should be as simple as doing a ./configure;make install

Use ./configure --prefix=/path/to/install to change the default install
location of /usr/local. I install alsaplayer in my /opt tree so I configure it
as follows:

./configure --prefix=/opt

The alsaplayer binary will then be placed in /opt/bin after the make install.
(it is in /usr/local/bin by default). For a complete list of configure options
run the configure script with --help

Installing from CVS
===================

If you have a copy of alsaplayer checked out from the CVS, you should run
the bootstrap script to create the autogenerated files. After this step you 
should run configure, and then run make to compile it.
