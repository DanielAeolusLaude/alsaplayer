TODO list (2007 May 28)

- make a pre-release with the GTK2 interface. Will be done very shortly.
- global: move libalsaplayer to a standalone application with unix-sockets or
  TCP- (UDP-?) based interface.
  This will include (list of ideas at that time):
  - Adding TCP-based control module in parallel with unix-socket based one.
  - Separating libalsaplayer and checking for crossplatform-readiness.
  - Separating all the interfaces.
- global: add gettext support
- global: new preference option to start or not playing at startup
- gtk2: preferences interface
- gtk: backport the gtk2 changes to gtk when it is possible. Any volunter?
- flac: check the Makefile. With flac>= 1.4, the oggflac test is not needed.
  Maybe separate the flac>1.4 patch into separated files.

Know bugs:
- fix the quiet option, see http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bug-report.cgi?bug=412112
