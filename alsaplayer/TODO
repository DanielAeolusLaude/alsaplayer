TODO list (2007 May 28)

- global: move libalsaplayer to a standalone application with unix-sockets or
  TCP- (UDP-?) based interface.
  This will include (list of ideas at that time):
  - Adding TCP-based comtrol module in parallel with unix-socket based one.
  - Separating libalsaplayer and checking for crossplatform-readiness.
  - Separating all interface.
- global: add gettext support
- global: new preference option to start or not playing at startup
- gtk2: add tooltips
- gtk2: preferences interface
- gtk2: make the loop button in playlist window to work
- gtk2: pause must resume playing at the last speed, not normal speed
- cdda: fix cddb support
- gtk: backport the gtk2 changes to gtk when it is possible
- gtk*: when using console commands to change the speed, the speed is
  changed but those interfaces are not aware of it. Fix it.

Old TODO list order according to priority, highest first

- Write proper documentation for the plugin APIs
- Preferences interface
- Complete default interface redesign
- Proper CD player controls
- Skin support (only the main window)
- Remember position when saving playlists
- accomplish suitability for small/embedded systems
