Introduction
------------
These are python bindings for the alsaplayer library. The intent
is to provide a set of bindings that closely mirror the C library,
leaving more complex functionality for purely python modules.


Requirements
------------
* python [http://python.org] including development headers and library
* boost [http://boost.org] with boost.python enabled
* alsaplayer [http://alsaplayer.org] including development headers and library


Building
--------
In most cases, you should be able to build everything with this command:

	python setup.py build

In the event that you have headers or libraries in non-standard locations,
you can edit setup.cfg to add those directories to the appropriate 
build variables.

Installation
------------
You can install the extension module by running:

	python setup.py install

Note that you'll probably need to do this as root.
