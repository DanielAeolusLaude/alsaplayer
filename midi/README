This is a midi input plugin for alsaplayer.  It is derived from
Tuukka Toivonen's TiMidity.  Compile and install it
in alsaplayer's input/ plugin directory, then you can play midi files.
The patches I've include don't sound like much.  I haven't figured
out whether I should include a real soundfont with the distribution.

TiMidity needs both patches and a configuration file, "timidity.cfg",
to tell it what patches are available and where to get them.  If you
run ./configure with no options, a directory "timidity" will be installed
in /usr/local/share containing a sample timidity.cfg and a very
small set of 7 patches.  If you specified a prefix for ./configure,
the timidity directory will be {prefix}/share/timidity.  There is
also a configuration option to put it elsewhere:
	./configure --with-timidity=/home/greg/tconfig
for instance, will make that the directory for the config file
timidity.cfg.  If you already have a timidity setup, you can
use this option to point to it, since a pre-existing file
timidity.cfg will not be overwritten during installation.

You can put a timidity.cfg in your home directory, inside the
.alsaplayer config directory, if you like,  The midi plugin will
look there first, and if it finds timidity.cfg, that will override
the one in the installation config directory, discussed just above.

The syntax of timidity.cfg is rather involved, and I look forward to
documenting it at some future time.  It's possible that a timidity.cfg
and patches you're using with Timidity++, if you've installed that variant of
TiMidity, would work with the midi plugin, too.
