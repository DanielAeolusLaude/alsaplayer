This is a midi input plugin for alsaplayer.  It is derived from
Tuukka Toivonen's TiMidity.  Compile and install it
in alsaplayer's input/ plugin directory, then you can play midi files.
The patches I've include don't sound like much.  I haven't figured
out whether I should include a real soundfont with the distribution.

midi-in needs both patches and a configuration file, "timidity.cfg",
to tell it what patches are available and where to get them.  If you
run ./configure with no options, a directory "timidity" will be installed
in /usr/local/share containing a sample timidity.cfg and a very
small set of 7 patches.  If you specified a prefix for ./configure,
the timidity directory will be {prefix}/share/timidity.  There is
also a configuration option to put it elsewhere:
	./configure --with-timidity=/home/greg/tconfig
for instance, will make that the directory for the config file
timidity.cfg.  If you already have a timidity setup, you can
use this option to point to it, since a pre-existing file
timidity.cfg will not be overwritten during installation.

You can put a timidity.cfg in your home directory, inside the
.alsaplayer config directory, if you like,  The midi plugin will
look there first, and if it finds timidity.cfg, that will override
the one in the installation config directory, discussed just above.

You can also put a soundfont in your ~/.alsaplayer/ directory, and
the midi plugin will automatically construct a timidity.cfg for it.
The name of the soundfont file (or a soft link) that you put in
~/.alsaplayer must end in ".sf2" or ".SF2", and of course it must
actually be a version 2 soundfont.  The timidity.cfg that is
constructed will overwrite any preexisting file timidity.cfg in
that directory.  If there is more than one soundfont file there,
midi-in will choose the first one it happens to notice.

The syntax of timidity.cfg is documented in the man page midi-in.1.
It's possible that a timidity.cfg and patches you're using with
TiMidity++, if you've installed that variant of TiMidity, would work
with the midi plugin, too.
