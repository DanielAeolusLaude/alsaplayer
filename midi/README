This is a midi input plugin for alsaplayer.  It is derived from
Tuukka Toivonen's TiMidity and reflects the work of a number
of other people (see AUTHORS).  Compile and install it
in alsaplayer's input/ plugin directory, install a soundfont,
then you can play midi files with alsaplayer.

Compiling:
	Alsaplayer must previously have been installed.
	Unless you need special configuration options, type
		./bootstrap  (if this is the CVS version)
		./configure
		make install
	to compile and install midi-in.  However, if you
	want to install somewhere other than in the
	/usr/local/ hierarchy, use the --prefix option
	to configure (see the INSTALL document).  midi_in
	will look for soundfonts and patch configuration
	files in the directory /usr/local/share/timidity,
	unless you gave the --prefix option to change
	/usr/local to something else.  There is also a
	separate configure option to tell midi_in to look
	elsewhere for patch information:
		./configure --with-timidity=<directory>

Installing a soundfont:
	The best and most straightforward way of providing
	patches for midi-in, IMO, is to download Jim Roe's soundfont
	PC42b.sf2, which is in a separate file accompanying
	this distribution.  (Now, it is in the alsaplayer
	CVS Files section in the tar archive PC42b.tar.bz2.)
	It's quite large.
	  Unpack the tar file, and put the file PC42b.sf2 in your
	home directory in a subdirectory .alsaplayer (where
	alsaplayer keeps its configuration info).  Or
	alternatively, you can put it in
	/usr/local/share/timidity, or wherever you configured
	midi-in to look for patch info (see above).
	You can use soft links, also.

Installing a soundfont (alternative):
	If you prefer some other soundfont, you can put that
	in <home>/.alsaplayer/ instead of PC42b.sf2.  When
	midi_in sees it there, it will automatically construct
	a patch configuration file for it called timiditiy.cfg,
	which, if you like, you can subsequently edit (there
	is a man page midi_in.1 telling about the format of
	.cfg files).

Installing a soundfont (second alternative):
	Design your own patch configuration file timidity.cfg
	and put it in <home>/.alsaplayer/ .  midi_in will look
	first for <home>/.alsaplayer/timidity.cfg and use
	the information there, in preference to other alternatives.

Installing a soundfont (third alternative):
	Don't install a soundfont, but use GUS patches, instead.
	If you happen to have installed TiMidity++ and Eric
	Welsh's eawpats, or some other set, and your file
	/usr/local/lib/timidity/timidity.cfg is set up for
	timidity++ to use them, midi_in can use them, too.
	(The eawpats set of GUS patches is at
	http://www.stardate.bc.ca/eawpatches/eawpats12_full.rar)
