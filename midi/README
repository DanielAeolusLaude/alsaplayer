This is a midi input plugin for alsaplayer.  Compile and install it
in alsaplayer's input/ plugin directory, then you can play midi files.
You can, that is, if you happen to have a timidity/ patch directory
on your system.  The plugin won't play without patches.  I'll be
uploading some pretty soon.
