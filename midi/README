The midi subdirectory has revised plugin code; I have in the alsaplayer
source tree as a daughter of /input.   I haven't included the timidity/
patch directory.  The Makefile.am points to the timidity/ directory as
a sister of the installation input/ directory.

There is a separate read-midi routine now which just gets info.  It's
possible to bomb out by adding to the playlist too quickly.  When a
file is added to the playlist, timidity immediately starts playing it.
The song time is not right yet.  Seek-to-frame still doesn't work.

The sample-midis directory has some midis, in case you're short of test
files.  The larger ones strain timidity's capacity.
