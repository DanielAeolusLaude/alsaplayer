This tar file contains Jim Roe's "Personal Copy" soundfont PC42b.sf2.  It is
required for alsaplayer's midi plugin midi_in.  To use it with midi_in,
either place it in the .alsaplayer subdirectory of your home directory
or put it in the directory that is midi_in's default path, which is
ordinarily /usr/local/share/timidity (but can be changed when you run
./configure during installation of midi_in).

The file www.personalcopy.html points to Jim Roe's website, where you'll
find possible updates to the soundfont, other sound fonts, and other
information.
