TTA Hardware Players Library
============================

Version 1.2, (c) 2004 Alexander Djourik. All rights reserved.

* Introduction

This library provides to decode a multichannel 8,16 and 24
bits TTA audio files. TTA is a lossless audio format. Being
"lossless" means that no data/quality is lost in the compression
- when uncompressed, the data will be identical to the original.

At now, mostly all of the popular lossless compressors gives
a same compression results (difference about 1-3%). TTA is a
hardware-oriented format. It means that the TTA format has a
reasonable compression level, but WAS NOT developed to show
a top results in comparisons.

TTA format supports both of ID3v1/v2 tags. Detailed format
description is available at http://www.true-audio.com.

The decoder process has a minimal system requirements and does
not required to create a big additional memory pools. As the
TTA algorithms has a same system requirements both for decoding
and for encoding processes - the TTA recorder can be easily
realized also.
