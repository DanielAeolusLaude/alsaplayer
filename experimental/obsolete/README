Here is some obsolete stuffs.

We moved them form the main tree and don't have any plan
to pursue any kind of development with this.

The qt interface has never worked.

If you want to use the gtk1 interface, look for the release called
alsaplayer-0.99.80-gtk1. It contain a few fixes that have never been 
released in the older releases.

The scope folder contain the gtk1 visualization plugins.

The fftscope folder contain the gtk1 version of /trunk/fftscope.

input/mad contain the code of the mad input plugin before removing
the outdated mad code that was included with AlsaPlayer.
